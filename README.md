# SmartDarts
Application meant to be run on SBCs (like Raspberry Pi) that have GPIO support





You will also need to "hack" an electronic dartboard.
These can be found at sport stores and usually are pretty cheap.

## Supported SBCs
I have only RPi 4 (2GB) available so it is the only one supported out-of-box for now.
It should work with RPi 3, 4 and 5.

## "Hacking" dartboard
You will need to open electronic dartboard and connect pins from the actuall dartboard to the GPIO of your SBC
